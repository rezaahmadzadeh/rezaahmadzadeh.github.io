<h2>Bio</h2>

<div id="body">
<p>
Reza Ahmadzadeh is a Postdoctoral Research Fellow with the School of Interactive Computing at 
Georgia Tech. He is a member of the Robot Autonomy and Interactive Learning (RAIL) research lab 
directed by Prof. Sonia Chernova. Prior to joining Georgia Tech, he was a Postdoctoral Fellow 
with the Humanoid Sensing and Perception lab in the Department of iCub Facility at Italian Institute
of Technology. 
</p>
<p>
Reza earned his Ph.D. in "Robotic, Cognition, and Interaction Technologies" in 2015 jointly from 
the University of Genoa and Italian Institute of Technology. He also received a B.Sc. degree in 
Solid Mechanics, Mechanical Engineering in 2001, and an M.Sc. degree in Robotics and Control, 
Mechanical Engineering in 2004. 
</p>
<p>
His research focuses on developing learning approaches to increasing the level of autonomy in 
robots, enabling non-experts to teach new skills to robots effortlessly, and being applicable to 
a wide range of robotic tasks. He has developed two new robot learning approaches, 
Visuospatial Skill Learning (2013) and Generalized Cylinders Learning (2016).
